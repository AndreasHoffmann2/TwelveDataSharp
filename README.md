# TwelveDataSharp
A .NET Standard 2.0 library for accessing Twelve Data's stock market APIs

https://twelvedata.com/docs

# Features
* Compatible with projects that target .NET Standard 2.0 including .NET Framework, .NET Core, and Xamarin
* Aims to access all APIs (work in progress, starting with Time Series and high demand technical indicators first)
* Lightweight with just a single external dependency (Newtonsoft.JSON)
* Response data is automatically converted to a more appropriate data type (i.e a stock price is provided as a string in JSON and then converted to a double)

# NuGet
https://www.nuget.org/packages/TwelveDataSharp/

# Usage

Just create a client object with your Twelve Data API key and call the async function for the respective API endpoint you'd like to hit. Additional detailed documentation is coming soon.

`using TwelveDataSharp;`

`TwelveDataClient client = new TwelveDataClient("YOUR_API_KEY_HERE");`

`var response = await client.GetTimeSeriesAsync("AAPL");`

`Console.WriteLine("Open:" + response.Values[0].Open);`
