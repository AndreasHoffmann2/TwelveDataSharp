# TwelveDataSharp
A .NET Standard 2.0 library for accessing Twelve Data's stock market APIs

https://twelvedata.com/docs

# Features
* Compatible with projects that target .NET Standard 2.0 including .NET Framework, .NET Core, and Xamarin
* Aims to access all APIs (work in progress, starting with Time Series and Reference Data first)
* Lightweight with just a single external dependency (Newtonsoft.JSON)
* Response data is automatically converted to a more appropriate data type (i.e a stock price is provided as a string in JSON and then converted to a double)

# Usage

Just create a client object with your Twelve Data API key and call the async function for the respective API endpoint you'd like to hit. Additional detailed documentation is coming soon.

`using TwelveDataSharp;`

`TwelveDataClient client = new TwelveDataClient("YOUR_API_KEY_HERE");`

`var response = await client.GetTimeSeriesAsync("AAPL");`

`Console.WriteLine("Open:" + response.Values[0].Open);`

# NuGet
A NuGet package will be available on nuget.org after additional endpoints are added and testing is performed, stay tuned. In the meantime you can always clone the repo and build the nuget package yourself.
