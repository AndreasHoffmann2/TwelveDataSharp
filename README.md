* Lightweight with with just a single external dependency (Newtonsoft.JSON)
* Response data from APIs is converted automatically and ready to use, including conversion of numerical data in strings to the appropriate primtive type

# Usage

Just create a client object with your Twelve Data API key and call the async function for the respective API endpoint you'd like to hit. Additional detailed documentation is coming soon.

`using TwelveDataSharp;`

`TwelveDataClient client = new TwelveDataClient("YOUR_API_KEY_HERE");`

`var response = await client.GetTimeSeriesAsync("AAPL");`

`Console.WriteLine("Open:" + response.Values[0].Open);`

# NuGet
A NuGet package will be available on nuget.org after additional endpoints are added and testing is performed, stay tuned. In the meantime you can always clone the repo and build the nuget package yourself.
